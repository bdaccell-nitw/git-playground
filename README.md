Learn git by playing around with it and not the other way around 😎 ! BDACC 2025-26





    The best way to learn Git is to stop binge watching tutorials
    and just start doing it.

 Steps to follow
--
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account (if you don't have, make one!).
- Clone your version of forked repository to your local machines.
- Fix the bugs/Optimize codes :  Make the necessary changes to fix issues in the python files in `codes/` folder (marked with `# BUG` or `# TASK`) .
- Create a new branch: For each issue you want to fix or optimize  , create a new branch with a descriptive name   
  (e.g., `fix-bug4-syntax_error`).
- Commit changes : Commit your changes to your branch with a descriptive commit message explaining the issue you fixed or the improvement you made.
- Push to GitHub: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Create a Pull Request (PR): Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repository, describing the issue you fixed and the changes you made.
